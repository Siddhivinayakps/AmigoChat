AmigoChat is a git repository for a 1 on 1 stranger chat app, developed using Unity and Photon. The app enables users to anonymously connect with other users in real-time and engage in one-on-one conversations. The user interface is designed to be intuitive and user-friendly, allowing users to easily find and connect with other users based on their interests.

The app is built using Unity, a cross-platform game engine, and Photon, a cloud-based networking platform that allows for real-time communication between users. These technologies enable the app to provide a seamless and immersive chat experience, with low latency and high reliability.

The AmigoChat repository contains all the necessary code, assets, and documentation required to build and deploy the app. It includes scripts for managing matchmaking, and chat sessions, as well as a suite of customizable UI elements and graphics.

Developers can use the AmigoChat repository as a starting point for building their own 1 on 1 chat apps, or as a reference for implementing real-time networking and communication features in other types of applications.
